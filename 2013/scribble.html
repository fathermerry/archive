                 FREE! Nothing irks business owners more than this word. A mere mention of it is enough to get even the most mild-mannered of them irate. From the dangling signs pleading: “Businesses thrive when family and friends pay for services rendered,” to the subliminal responses: “We will get back to you,” most businesses have one pre-emptive measure or the other to protect themselves from FREEBIE lovers.   
                </p>
                
                <p>After all the sleepless (and sexless) nights, the money spent, your overheads, the struggle just to keep the lights on, somebody tells you to consider giving up your product for free? It’s got to be a joke. Well… </p>
                
                <p>Small businesses tend to view any request for free goods or services from an exploitative perspective. But what if giving away a product free is programmed as part of the route to the market? What if it’s part of a plan to show how truly great a product is? What if free is made a part of the armory to get products into the hands of more people, thereby aiding word-of-mouth advertisement? What if it’s a ploy to get quick feedback from first users and take the product and feedback back to the lab for tweaking before mass producing?</p>
                
                <p>
                    Let’s be honest, free will get your product in the hands of people faster than any marketing campaign will. What happens next is, however, a function of the brand’s experience.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    Is the product or service so spectacular as to warrant a repeat visit or is it just a dud not to be touched again? </p>
                <p>
                    The question now is:  Can your product stand the “test of free?” Can you be confident enough to give it up for nothing knowing that it will attract a sizeable number of people the second time around? Can you do it like the creators of the DOOM video game who knew their game was so hot they gave it up for zilch and today are sitting on a million dollar franchise? Or can you do it like the musician who got tired of asking for a deal and took it upon himself to drop a collection of songs as a FREE download and today is being hailed as the best thing to happen to the industry? </p>
                <p>
                    FREE isn’t for everyone or for every brand (it’s popular among tech businesses) but if you are truly one of the exemplary ones, it could do you a ton of good. </p>
